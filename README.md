# Wavefront
This algorithm is capable of finding the optimal route to the goal in the planning phase, in the initial state. For this purpose, it analyses the map and generates the path in an off-line manner. When finished, the robot simply follows the generated path.

# Setup
## Requirements
- Matlab  
- Peter Corkeâ€™s RVC toolbox 
- CoppeliaSim simulator
- Matlab bindings for CoppeliaSim
  
>[!IMPORTANT]
> It is required to use a fairly recent version of Matlab, versions older than 2011 may cause problems.

## CoppeliaSim and Robotics Toolbox
- Download `CoppeliaSim EDU` and unpack it in the `~/ws_emor` workspace directory.  
- Download [EMOR tutorials repository](https://github.com/RCPRG-ros-pkg/emor_trs/archive/master.zip) and unzip it in  `~/ws_emor`.

### Install the CoppeliaSim bindings for Matlab:  
Copy the following three files from the directory of the `CoppeliaSim` to the directory named `youbot` within your local copy of `EMOR tutorials repository` downloaded above. 

The three files you need to copy are:
- `remApi.m`: located in `{CoppeliaSim_path}/programming/remoteApiBindings/matlab/matlab`

> [!NOTE]
> In the newest version of CoppeliaSim, the files may be located in `{CoppeliaSim_path}/programming//legacyRemoteApi/remoteApiBindings/matlab/matlab`

- `remoteApiProto.m`: located in `{CoppeliaSim_path}/programming/remoteApiBindings/matlab/matlab`  
- `remoteApi.so` (if you use Linux) or `remoteApi.dll` (if you use Windows) or `remoteApi.dylib` (if you use a Mac). If you have a choice between a 32-bit or 64-bit `remoteApi`, pick the one that corresponds to your Matlab install. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have 32-bit Matlab, pick the 32-bit remoteApi, even if your kernel is 64-bit. 

  The file is located in `{CoppeliaSim_path}/programming/remoteApiBindings/lib/lib` You will find these files in the directory containing the CoppeliaSim app. Look in the `programming/remoteApiBindings/lib/lib and programming/remoteApiBindings/matlab/matlab` subdirectories of the CoppeliaSim app directory (although this can change from version to version). You must copy these files to the youbot directory within your copy of `EMOR tutorials repository`.
- Run Matlab and change the current directory to the youbot directory (in Matlab Command Window), e.g. on Linux/Mac:

  ```matlab
  cd ~/ws_emor/emor_trs/youbot
  ```
    
- Then type (in Matlab):  
  ```matlab
  vrep=remApi('remoteApi');   
  vrep.delete();
  ```  
## Simulation
You can run the simulation with the following command in the MATLAB console: 

`run_simulation(@wavefront_main, false, [goal_x, goal_y], map_filename)`

- `wavefront_main` is the control callback function.
- `[goal_x, goal_y]` is the position of the goal point.
- `map_filename` is the name of the map file.

```matlab
run_simulation(@wavefront_main, false, [-0.5, 3.8], "map.png")
```

It also plots the state of the Wavefront Planner for debugging and visualization purposes.
The planner runs in the initial state. Then the robot moves to the subsequent cells on the path generated by Wavefront.
